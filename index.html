          <p> This is a one player game where you play against the computer.  During your turn, you need to swap two adjacent tiles. You need to click on each of the two tiles you would like to swap. You can only swap two tiles that will result in any color match of at least three tiles. If you match up red tiles, your opponent's (computer's) health is reduced by the amount of matched tiles since your opponent's health bar is red. The computer will also match tiles and will reduce your health whenever it matches up blue tiles since your health bar is blue. Matching up any other colors won't cause any damage. You can only match up adjacent tiles and you do so by clicking on both tiles that you would like to swap. You win the game by completely destroying your opponent (reducing their health to zero).
