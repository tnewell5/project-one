STABBY CRAB ADVENTURES

What kind of game is this?
  This game is a color tiles matching game played by either 2 players or by 1 player vs computer.
How does the game work?
  Each player is a Stabby Crab, who is assigned a color that represents its health/life.
  The player will try to match the color tiles of the opponent's health on the game board, and will need to match at least 3 tiles in a row or column. Each matched tile will decrease the opponent's health by some amount.  The opponent will then take a turn and do the same, trying to match the color tiles of the opponent's health to try and kill the opponent. Once some tiles are matched up, the board will be reset/ refilled with new tiles.  Once a player's life/health is depleted, the winner is declared (the player with remaining life/health).

Behind the scenes:
  I will probably use flex-box to display the tiles and will assign a color class to each tile (ex: red tiles will have a class of "red").  I will use the shuffle or a random number generator function to refill the board.  I am planning on using the Stabby Crab image/gif from the internet - is that okay?

Challenges:
  How to refill the board with new tiles.  Typically, when tiles get matched up, other tiles cascade down to fill the newly opened spots.  Then, brand-new tiles fill in the gaps on top of the board.  I will see if I'm able to do this.  If not, I may need to simplify this and just reset the board to one with brand-new tiles (not sure yet).


  How to assign keys/ clicks to the buttons to let the player swap two tiles.  I know how to add a click-event to a single click or key, but would need to figure out how to do some type of click and drag key function to enable the player swap adjacent tiles.

  Can't wait to embark on the Stabby Crab coding adventure!!
