// game play:
// ask if 1 or 2 players, initiate health bars
// health bar gets a color, sets health to max health
// asks player1 to make a move by clicking on two
// adjacent tiles. Checks to see if tiles are adjacent
//if adjacent, swap the tiles in array and display
//if not adjacent, asks player1 to re-swap tiles
//once two tiles are swapped, need to check if there is
// a match of at least 3 adjacent tiles of the same color
// if so, check to see if the matched tile color corresponds
// to any player's health color and then reduce that
// player's health bar accordingly by that amount and
// refill the matched tile slots with new random tiles
// if there is no match of at least 3 adjacent tiles,
// undo the swap and ask player to swap again
