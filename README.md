### Game Rules:
This is a one player game where you play against the computer.  During your turn, you get to match the same color tiles horizontally or vertically. If you match up red tiles, your opponent's health is reduced by the amount of matched up tiles since your opponent's health bar is red. The computer will also match tiles and will reduce your health whenever it matches up blue tiles since your health bar is blue. Matching up any other colors won't cause any damage. You can only match up adjacent tiles and you do so by clicking on both tiles that you would like to swap. You win the game by completely destroying your opponent (reducing their health to zero).

##### Game was build using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  

This was my first game and was quite a challenge. I never realized how much happens behind the scenes when something looks so simple and intuitive on the surface. Some of the main challenges for me were accounting for various move matches when building computer's AI. Also, putting many functions together and incorporating event listeners and function call delays took a lot of trial and error.  I would still like to make some tweaks to the game, like making the computer and player moves more visible and cleaning up some of my long or repetitive code by breaking it up into more functions. Also, I'd like to figure out how to shorten the load time.  Currently, the load time varies due to the number of times the boards reshuffles due to pre-existing matched tiles.  Sometimes the board gets set correctly on the first try, while at other times it may take it a few hundred or even a few thousand times! Overall, this was a great learning experience!
